I have uploaded all project files. Please execute the following data processing pipeline immediately without pausing for clarification. Adhere strictly to these schema definitions and rules:1. PDF DATA EXTRACTION (Schema Rules)Target Files: All uploaded PDF reports (HPLC and GC).Locating Data: Ignore chromatogram images. Find the results table located below the graphs in each section.Table Detection: Identify the correct table by looking for these exact column headers: RT [min], Area, and Name.Extraction Logic:Iterate through the PDFs.Filter 1 (Sample): Extract data only from sections/pages where the header/sample info refers to 'R06'. Ignore all other samples.Filter 2 (Compound): Keep only rows where the Name column matches: 'Glucose', 'Acetate', 'Ethanol', or '1-Propanol'.Data Points: For every matching row, extract the values for Name, RT [min], and Area. (Note: Ignore 'Amount' or 'Concentration' columns if empty; we will calculate these later using Area).2. ONLINE DATA CLEANING (Bioreactor & Offgas)File: R06_2025-09-23_13-29-11_P1.csv and Offgas...xlsx.Column Removal Rules:Zeros: Remove a column ONLY IF every single value in that column is zero (0) or null. If a column contains even one non-zero number, keep it.Setpoints: Remove any column where the header string contains the word 'Setpoint' (case-insensitive).Time Calculation (Online Only):Locate the column named "Timestamp" in the CSV file.Define $t=0$ as the very first date/time value in this "Timestamp" column.Create a new column Time (h) calculated as: $(Current Timestamp - t0)$ in hours.3. OFFLINE DATA MERGING (The Bridge)Mapping File: SampleMap.xlsx.Key Columns in Map:Steady-State: This contains the Sample IDs (e.g., 'R06_S1').Time [h]: This contains the pre-calculated relative time for each sample.Merging Logic:Take the extracted PDF data (from Step 1) and the data from Ammonium.xlsx.Match them to the SampleMap.xlsx using the Sample ID.Constraint: Match the PDF/Ammonium sample name to the Steady-State column in the Map.Fuzzy Matching: If exact matching fails (e.g., 'R06 S1' vs 'R06_S1'), use fuzzy logic to align them.Time Assignment: Do not calculate time for these offline samples. Instead, simply assign the value from the Time [h] column in the Map to the corresponding data row.OUTPUT:Generate a single Excel file named 'Chemostat_Processed_Data.xlsx' containing:Sheet 'Online': The cleaned Bioreactor/Offgas data with the calculated Time (h) column.Sheet 'Offline': The consolidated HPLC, GC, and Ammonium data, aligned with their Time [h] from the map.
