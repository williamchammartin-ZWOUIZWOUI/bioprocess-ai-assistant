I have uploaded the project files for the chemostat analysis. Please execute the following data processing pipeline immediately without pausing for clarification. Adhere strictly to these schema definitions and rules:

1. PDF DATA EXTRACTION (Schema Rules)
- Target Files:
    - HPLC: "HPLC-RID_Gluc_Acet_TP_Chemostat_2025.pdf", "HPLC-RID_Gluc_Acet_TP_Chemostat_2025_Second_Run.pdf"
    - GC: "TPChemostat_2025_02Oct25_GC_EtOH.pdf", "TPChemostat_2025_21Oct25_GC_EtOH.pdf"
- Locating Data: Ignore chromatogram images. Find the results table located below the graphs in each section.
- Table Detection: Identify the correct table by looking for these exact column headers: "RT [min]", "Area", and "Name".
- Extraction Logic:
    - Iterate through all PDFs.
    - Filter 1 (Sample): Extract data ONLY from sections/pages where the header/sample info refers to 'R06'. Ignore all other samples.
    - Filter 2 (Compound): Keep ONLY rows where the 'Name' column matches: 'Glucose', 'Acetate', 'Ethanol', or '1-Propanol'.
    - Data Points: For every matching row, extract the values for 'Name', 'RT [min]', and 'Area'. (Note: Ignore 'Amount' or 'Concentration' columns if empty; we will calculate these later using 'Area').

2. ONLINE DATA CLEANING & TIME STANDARDIZATION
- Global Reference Time (t=0): Locate the column named "Timestamp" in the file "R06_2025-09-23_13-29-11_P1.csv". The very first date/time value in this column is t=0.
- Bioreactor Data ("R06_2025-09-23_13-29-11_P1.csv"):
    - IMPORTANT: This file uses a semicolon (;) as the delimiter. Ensure you parse it correctly.
    - Remove any column where the header string contains the word "Setpoint" (case-insensitive).
    - Remove a column ONLY IF every single value in that column is zero (0) or null. If a column contains even one non-zero number, keep it.
    - Create a column "Time (h)" calculated as: (Current Timestamp - t0) in hours.
- Offgas Data ("Offgas_251021_TP Chemostat_R06.xlsx"):
    - Apply the same t=0 reference to calculate "Time (h)" for this file.

3. OFFLINE DATA MERGING (The Bridge)
- Ammonium Data ("Ammonium.xlsx"):
    - Note: This file contains approximately 17 rows of metadata/header information at the top. Skip these rows until you locate the actual data table.
    - The first column of the data table represents the Sample ID.
- Mapping File ("SampleMap.xlsx"):
    - "Steady-State": This column contains the Sample IDs (e.g., 'R06_S1').
    - "Time [h]": This contains the pre-calculated relative time for each sample. Use this value directly; do not recalculate time for offline samples.
- Merging Logic:
    1. Consolidate the extracted PDF data (from Step 1) and the "Ammonium.xlsx" data.
    2. Match them to "SampleMap.xlsx" using the Sample ID.
    3. Fuzzy Matching: If exact name matching fails (e.g., 'R06 S1' vs 'R06_S1'), use fuzzy logic to align them.

4. FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE
Generate a single Excel file named "Chemostat_Processed_Data.xlsx" containing exactly these three sheets:
- Sheet 1: "Online Bioreactor"
    - Contains the cleaned data from "R06_2025-09-23_13-29-11_P1.csv" with the calculated "Time (h)".
- Sheet 2: "Online Gas"
    - Contains the data from "Offgas_251021_TP Chemostat_R06.xlsx" with the calculated "Time (h)".
- Sheet 3: "Offline Analysis"
    - Contains the merged HPLC, GC, and Ammonium data.
    - Rows must be aligned by the "Time [h]" found in the Sample Map.
